Polyp Segmentation using U-Net

Overview

This project implements a U-Net-based deep learning model for the segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images. Polyp segmentation is a critical task in early detection and treatment planning for colorectal cancer. This project provides a robust, efficient, and accurate method for automated polyp segmentation, aimed at assisting healthcare professionals.

Algorithm and Approach

 U-Net Architecture
U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for image segmentation tasks. The architecture is composed of two main parts:

1. Contracting Path (Encoder): This part of the network follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded), each followed by a ReLU and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step, the number of feature channels is doubled.

2. Expanding Path (Decoder): This path is symmetric to the contracting path and consists of upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number of feature channels. A concatenation with the corresponding feature map from the contracting path and two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU, complete the upsampling step.

 Data Preprocessing

1. Normalization: The input images are normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1 to help with the training stability and convergence of the neural network.

2. Data Augmentation: Given the limited amount of medical data, various augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to the training images to artificially increase the dataset size and improve model generalization.

3. Resizing: Images and corresponding masks are resized to a standard dimension (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256) to ensure consistency in training.

 Model Training

- Loss Function: A combination of Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice Loss is used to address the imbalance in pixel classes (background vs. polyp). BCE handles overall pixel classification, while Dice Loss focuses on overlap between predicted and actual masks.

- Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is chosen for its efficiency in dealing with sparse gradients and noisy data.

- Learning Rate: A scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate during training to help with convergence and to avoid getting stuck in local minima.

 Evaluation

- Dice Coefficient: A commonly used metric in medical image segmentation, the Dice coefficient measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.

- IoU (Intersection over Union): Another metric that evaluates the overlap ratio of the predicted segmentation to the ground truth.

 Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polypsegmentation-unet.git
   
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
      cd polypsegmentation-unet
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
   Use the `requirements.txt` file to install necessary packages.
     pip install -r requirements.txt

 

 Data Preparation
- Dataset Structure: Organize your dataset as follows:
  data/
  ├── train_images/
  ├── train_masks/
  ├── test_images/
  └── test_masks/
  
  - `train_images/` contains training images.
  - `train_masks/` contains corresponding ground truth masks for training images.
  - `test_images/` contains test images.
  - `test_masks/` contains ground truth masks for evaluation.

 Training the Model

1. Configure Training Parameters: Before training, you can set various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the `train.py` script.

2. Run Training Script:
      python scripts/train.py

   This script will train the U-Net model using the provided training dataset. The trained model weights will be saved in the `models/` directory.

 Inference

To run inference on new images using the trained model:

1. Place the images in a directory, for example, `data/inference_images/`.

2. Use the inference script provided:
      python scripts/inference.py --input_dir data/inference_images/ --output_dir data/inference_results/
   This script will generate segmentation masks for the input images and save them to the specified output directory.

 Results
- Include results with images showing original images, ground truth masks, and predicted masks.
- Provide a quantitative summary of model performance using metrics such as Dice Coefficient and IoU.
